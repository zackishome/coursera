#About the Course#

This course examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level languages are implemented. We will develop students’ sense of “what really happens” when software runs — and that this question can be answered at several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level, the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level. The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor and the memory hierarchy), and the role of the operating system (but not how the operating system is implemented).

##Recommended Background##
Introductory programming in C or Java as well as familiarity with binary numbers.

##Suggested Readings##
Text are recommended but not required:

Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective, 2nd Edition (CS:APP2e) 
Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron 
Prentice-Hall, 2010

Purchase direct from Pearson 
Purchase eBook from CourseSmart 
Purchase print or Kindle edition from Amazon.com

Students are also encouraged to have access to a good C reference – any will do – there are many available on the web as well:

The C Programming Language (Kernighan and Ritchie) 
C: A Reference Manual (Harbison and Steele)

Course Format
Video lecture topics. Written homework and programming assignments. Only the programming assignments will be graded. The written assignments provide students with a sense for the kinds of topics and analysis are considered most important.
