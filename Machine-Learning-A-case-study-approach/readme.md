Welcome to Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach! By joining this course, you’ve taken a first step in becoming a machine learning expert. You will learn a broad range of machine learning methods for deriving intelligence from data, and by the end of the course you will be able to implement actual intelligent applications. These applications will allow you to perform predictions, personalized recommendations and retrieval, and much more. If you continue with the subsequent courses in the Machine Learning specialization, you will delve deeper into the methods and algorithms, giving you the power to develop and deploy new machine learning services.

To begin, we recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site. Review the material we’ll cover each week, and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course. These assignments---one per Module 2 through 6---will walk you through Python implementations of intelligent applications for:
Predicting house prices
Analyzing the sentiment of product reviews
Retrieving Wikipedia articles
Recommending songs
Classifying images with deep learning
All assignments use iPython notebooks for an interactive experience.
